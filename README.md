# GoT Fan Page Overview:
ASOIAF fan page is a fun project I made because I enjoy the world George R.R. Martin created. You are able to search through characters and view them and information about them. You can also add characters to a favorites list so you can access them easier.

# Technologies Used:

- Javascript
- CORS
- Express
- Node
- SQL
- Sequelize
- HTML 
- CSS

# Features:
Search Bar allows you to search using both upper and lower case letters. It just looks for what the search may include. You can search something like the letter j and it will search for anyone with j in there name. 

Add and Remove Favorites allows you to favorite a character onto your favorites list and get easier viewing access to that persons character-card. You can also remove them from that list
